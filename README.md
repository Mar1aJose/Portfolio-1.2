Personal portfolio . Test Module 2

Hi, I'm Maria José and this is my final project for the performance test of Module 2. 
In this portfolio I apply the knowledge acquired in HTML, CSS, responsive design, Flexbox and Grid, to build a functional personal website, 
visually attractive and adaptable to different devices.
About me

-I'm a web development student at Riwi, focused on becoming a junior frontend developer. 
Currently I complement my studies with neuroscience learning, which allows me to better understand how users think and act when interacting with interfaces, 
achieving more intuitive and empathetic experiences.
Structure of the site

-The portfolio is divided into three individual pages:
    Section 	                                Description
presentacion.html 	             My personal presentation, training, aspirations and professional approach.
portafolio.html 	               A sample of 3 functional projects developed in HTML, CSS and JS.
contacto.html 	                 Accessible and functional contact form.


The navigation between pages is implemented with a fixed, focused and stylized bar.
